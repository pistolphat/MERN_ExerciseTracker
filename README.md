# Just Exercise

Just Exercise is a simple and single page web application that enables the User to organize activities with the power to add, update, and delete a list of planned activities.

This full stack application enabled me to gain more practice and better familiarity building an application from the ground up. Building and setting up the back end with proper/restful routes, then deploying the API. For the front end, more practices with JavaScript ES6 functions, React ecosystem, but overall insights into the process.

 Something new and interesting was utilizing React component called Date Picker. It enabled a User to choose a date from a popped-up calendar.
